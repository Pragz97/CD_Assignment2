Soon, hearts will be broken and the damage, severe
You'll fall headless over heels once the 14th is here
He's back in town and he won't be undermined
Got a bone to pick and a fucking axe to grind
You're blushing while he's crushing cause' you've known it from the start
There's more than one way to lose your fucking heart
Love hurts
In my mine
Blunt force
Then you die
When the screams echo, "You'll be mine"
You know you're in for one hell of a ride
When the screams echo in the Hanniger mine
Cupid's calling for a homicide
When the screams echo, "You'll be mine"
You know you're in for one hell of a ride
When the screams echo in the Hanniger mine
I've picked you, My Bloody Valentine
He's back on top and he won't be warded off
A swinging single always down to call your Bluff
'Cause roses are red and violets are blue
They'll need your dental records to identify you
Love hurts
In my mine
Blunt force
Then you die
When the screams echo, "You'll be mine"
You know you're in for one hell of a ride
When the screams echo in the Hanniger mine
I've picked you, My Bloody Valentine
My Bloody Valentine
Love hurts
In my mine
Blunt force
Then you die
Can't stop this gas-masked lunatic
He cannot be confined
He's got a bone to pick
And a fucking axe to grind
He's got a bone to pick
A fucking axe to grind
The screams echo, "You'll be mine"
You know you're in for one hell of a ride
When the screams echo in the Hanniger mine
Cupid's calling for a homicide
When the screams echo, "You'll be mine"
You know you're in for one hell of a ride
When the screams echo in the Hanniger mine
I've picked you
I'll follow through
And that makes you
My Bloody Valentine
