Allow me to introduce myself
They call me the dancing clown
And you must be Georgie
Did you hear my circus was in town?
It seems I have your boat here
The storm blew her off track
Just reach your hands down here and take it
If you really want it back
Oh, Georgie
You can trust me sweet child
Step right this way
I'm at your service with a smile
Believe me
IT's nothing to fear
When I feast on your flesh
You'll see that we all float down...
Here!
Pick through the past you'll see
I'm living history
Come one come all
'Cause I'm starved for the kill
Prey on the pure at heart
Feed on their body parts
I've got some big fucking shoes to fill
Follow me and I'll show you the truth
Devastation as the dead lights defuse
Follow me and I'll show you the truth
Face down in the fountain of youth
Just like Georgie
IT's all out of hand
So join me
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Catch me at the big top
Buried underground
You know I'm not clowning around
Even with a smile
From ear to fucking ear
IT's everything you know
IT's everything you fear
A carnival of carnage
That much you assume
But it's more than just a costume and red balloons
IT's coming back around every 27 years
IT's everything you know
IT's everything you fear
So let go
You know what makes me smile?
Devoured juveniles
Their innards tangled in my twisted grin
Chuckled so hard I choked
Call it an inside joke
They say that laughter's the best medicine
Follow me and I'll show you the truth
Face down in the fountain of youth
Just like Georgie
IT's all out of hand
So join me
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Catch me at the big top
Buried underground
You know I'm not clowning around
Even with a smile
From ear to fucking ear
IT's everything you know
IT's everything you fear
A carnival of carnage
That much you assume
But it's more than just a costume and red balloons
IT's coming back around every 27 years
IT's everything you know
IT's everything you fear
So let go
IT is the end
IT's come again
Believe IT or not
You'll all disappear
IT cannot be fought
We all float down here
IT is the end
IT's come again
Believe IT or not
You'll all disappear
IT cannot be fought
We all float down here
IT is the end
IT's come again
Believe IT or not
You'll all disappear
IT cannot be fought
We all float down here
We all float down here
IT's come again
Believe IT or not
You'll all disappear
IT cannot be fought
We all float down here
