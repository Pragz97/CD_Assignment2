Slave to the plot, let them rot
Or bring them back forever
Sometimes
Sometimes dead is better
Yeah
Sometimes
Sometimes dead is better
They say, "behind those gates, eternal life awaits"
But souls beyond the grave, come back beyond depraved
With church bells ringing, I'll start digging
Fast, they'll never know he's missing
Now the cat's back in his cage
"Oh my God, Gage!"
(We pray to thee our God
(It's all my fault)
(For the blessings you've provided)
(Don't do it)
(I have to)
I'll see you on the other side
But I'd kill to bring you back tonight
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right (ah)
I'll dig through sorrow and disgust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right
Remember sometimes
Sometimes (dead is better)
Yeah
Sometimes
Sometimes dead is better
They say that time heals all
But I won't heed the call
Buried in misery
Spare me the eulogy
Still, I can't escape the struggle
Driven when push comes to shovel
Whether God's hand or my own
Nothing here is set in stone
Create! Cremate!
All hail the Cemetery!
I'll see you on the other side
But I'd kill to bring you back tonight
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right (ah)
I'll dig through sorrow and disgust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right
Remember
Sometimes (dead is better)
It all began with a skid on the pavement
It ends here with funeral derangements
The flesh is living but the souls have spoiled
The wrath of God lays beneath this soil
The flesh is living but the souls have spoiled
The wrath of God lays beneath this soil
I'll see you on the other side
But I'd kill to bring you back tonight
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right (ah)
I'll dig through sorrow and disgust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right (ah)
Remember
Sometimes
Sometimes (dead is better)
