In the wealthiest sections
A killer complexion is often a great alibi
Valentino couture mixed with violence and gore
(Well, I guess I'm a pretty sick guy)
With my beauty routines and a fridge full of spleens
Some might say it's extreme but it's time to say goodbye
So to hell with good intentions
So to hell is where I'll go
But the Devil makes exceptions
For all American psychos
You'll find no escape once you're captured on tape
I'm aware it's a bit avant-garde
(Not the f- face, you piece of trash)
Casually cleaving without ever grieving
But wait, let me give you my card (that's bone)
There is no real me, just a stark entity that cannot be redeemed
So it's time to say goodbye
So to hell with good intentions
So to hell is where I'll go
But the Devil makes exceptions
For all American psychos
Hold my calls, I'll kill them all
So to hell with good intentions
For all American psychos
Do you like Ice Nine Kills?
(Not really)
Their early work was a little bit too scene for me
But when The Silver Scream came out I think they really came into their own
Commercially and artistically
The whole album has a refined melodic sensibility that really makes it a cut above the rest
Hey Paul
Eric, hello, as my lawyer, you know
I'm psychotic but I've crossed the line
I killed Drew, Chris, and Mike, stabbed Jose with a knife
But I don't think I'm gonna get away with it, this time
To hell with good intentions
To hell is where I'll go
But the Devil makes exceptions
For all American psychos
Hold my calls, I'll kill them all
So to hell with good intentions
For all American
American Psychos
