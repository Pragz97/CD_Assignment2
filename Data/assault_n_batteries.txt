I'll be watching over you and every move you make
I may be made of plastic, but I'm wide awake
I'll be right by your side until the day you die
Your friend until the end, I'm your Good Guy
Hey, Andy!
It's time to play, motherfucker!
Through a child's eye, you'll find it's hard to refuse
A friendly freckled face (oh, honey, isn't he cute?)
But little do they know, little do they see
(That play time is over!)
It's a killing spree, bitch
Na-na-na boo-boo, he's gonna get you
E-V-I-L
D-O-L-L
Na-na-na boo-boo, violence and voodoo
You won't ever grow up
You won't make it past six
'Cause this two-foot tall demonic doll will make you his bitch
You won't ever grow up
He'll toy with you 'til you die
To prove that evil comes in every size
One child holds the truth, but he's labeled a liar
(One doll dismembered them all!)
(With no assembly required)
They won't know what to say
They won't know what to do
('Cause the carnage continues at a store near you!)
Na-na-na boo-boo, he's gonna get you
E-V-I-L
D-O-L-L
Na-na-na boo-boo, violence and voodoo
You won't ever grow up
You won't make it past six
'Cause this two-foot tall demonic doll will make you his bitch
You won't ever grow up
He'll toy with you 'til you die
To prove that evil comes in every size (na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
And once he's planted his seed
You'll know your life's been uprooted
'Cause safety's not guaranteed
(Assault and batteries included)
Stitched back together, it seems
By the evil bride of his dreams
(Heaven help you) if you hear him scream
Ade Due Damballa
(Attention shoppers, one soul left in stock)
Ade Due Damballa
(A new kid on the chopping block)
Yeah
You won't ever grow up
You won't make it past six
'Cause this two-foot tall demonic doll will make you his bitch
You won't ever grow up
He'll toy with you 'til you die
To prove that evil comes in every size (na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
You won't ever grow up
You won't make it past six
'Cause this two-foot tall demonic doll will make you his bitch
You won't ever grow up
He'll toy with you 'til you die
To prove that evil comes (evil comes)
Evil comes
In every size
Na-na-na boo-boo, fuck you!
